        Also returning to One Love is iconic Kiwi reggae pioneers Katchafire, who helped pave the
        way for many Kiwi artists in the genre. Their hits, including Get Away, Seriously, Love
        Letter, Down With You and Giddy Up remain as impactful as they were when they were released
        and feature in the playlists of many One Love regulars.

        One Love made its debut as a one-day festival in both Tauranga and Auckland in 2014 before
        settling as a two-day event in Tauranga exclusively in 2015. Since then it has become a
        staple on the summer festival calendar and has cemented itself as Aotearoa&apos;s ultimate
        celebration of reggae music.

        One Love Festival owner and promoter Glenn Meikle said he was excited for One Love 2025.

      <p>
        Meikle said adding a second stage at this year&apos;s event provided an opportunity to
        include more artists at One Love and also showcase more up-and-coming Kiwi musicians to
        bigger crowds.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The positive feedback from artists and attendees about this addition means we wanted to
        ensure we bring it back in 2025,” he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We love New Zealand music and we know our One Love whanau appreciate homegrown talent. We
        want to do what we can to cater to both artists and fans,” Meikle said.
